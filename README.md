Electric Meter Monitor

This is a work in progress! I will update as I have time. I will gladly answer specific questions, and if anyone is interested in more information on the project, I will contratate on building it out.

This project will read LED pulses from an electric meter.  The source code on the Raspberry Pi is common to any meter.  The schematic and arduino source code varies based on meter type, whether IR (infrared) or visible.

This was originally designed to work with the Itron CS1 or the DDS238-4 'induction' type submeter.
